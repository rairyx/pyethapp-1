With the config in setup.cfg it's possible to use bump2version to generate the
usual <major>.<minor>.<patch> (e.g. 1.5.0) releases as well as alpha and rc
ones (e.g. 1.6.0a1, 1.6.0rc2, etc). For the latter, one just has to tell
bump2version to update either the "release" or "num" parts. For example,
assuming a current version of 1.5.0:

  $ bump2version minor    # will update the current version to 1.6.0a0

  $ bump2version num      # will update the current version to 1.6.0a1

  $ bump2version release  # will update the current version to 1.6.0rc0

  $ bump2version num      # will update the current version to 1.6.0rc1

  $ bump2version release  # will update the current version to 1.6.0
